CSS :has() Selector | Glassmorphism Card Hover Effects

The :has() pseudo-class is designed to select elements that contain a specific element or elements within them. Here's an example of how it might work if it were supported:

div:has(p) {
  background-color: yellow;
}

In the above example, it would select all div elements that contain a p element and apply a background color of yellow to them.
